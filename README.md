###Learning Ruby on Rails

Created this mini-capstone repo to practice using the Rails instructions I have listed here: https://gist.github.com/Rvndyr/2d46d40423b18c7a7975c348e9f6fb81

##Things I learned here: 
 - Model Inheretance
    If I use the ```rails generate model Products name:string price:integer img_url:string description:string``` command, I dont need to initialize my class in the Products.rb file under the models directory.
